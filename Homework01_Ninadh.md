#Homework 1#

##This is a repository of Homework 1 for STAT545 class.##

*Description:* The task is to **"edit"** the README.md file.

*About myself:* My name is Ninadh D'Costa and I am PhD student in the Faculty of Medicine investigating kidney cancer and chemo-resistance. I have never done any coding before and R-studio seems very confusing. STAT545 is an amazing class that will help me get to understand R better. **So far**, it has been very helpful. [Here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/) is the link to Classroom.
